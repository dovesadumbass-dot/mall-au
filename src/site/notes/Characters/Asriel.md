## Early Life
Asriel was born to Greyoll and Valkyrie Rostadottir and lived with her father for 5 years, while her mother was deployed. When Valkyrie returned, she served Greyoll with divorce papers and moved out of the house, taking Asriel with her. After the courts returned Asriel into Greyoll's custody, she was kidnapped by her mother and stayed there for less than a week. Because of the disasterous nature of her parents divorce, Asriel was sent to live with a woman nicknamed Ice Blue and her son through the Big Brother Big Sister Program.

With Ice Blue and Fir, Asriel finished elementary and middle school, becoming a voracious reader and excelling in her classes despite lagging behind socially. At the age of 14, she was given a choice to live with Valkyrie again, now that the divorce was finalized and it was deemed safe, or to stay with her Big Family. Asriel chose to try again living with her mother and moved in quickly.

## Modern Day
Asriel works at Barnes and Noble as a selection curator, designing stands and sections to appeal to other young people and presenting her managers with recommendations and research to support new book orders. She still lives with Valkyrie and her adoptive brother Izzy, but tensions rise between her and her mother any time her childhood comes up.
