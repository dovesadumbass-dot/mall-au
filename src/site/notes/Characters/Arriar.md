## Early Life
Arriar was born in the year 2003 to Agnarious Ardere and ---- Aredere only 5 months after they were married. Soon after his birth multiple Nannies and private tutors were hired to ensure that he would have the same education as his father and be prepared to take on his family's legacy of business and politics.

He grew up alongside his half-sister [[Characters/Xexiax\|Xexiax]], and they were very close as children despite their 6 year age gap. He believed that she moved out of her own volition at 18 because of a spat with Agnarious and that she didn't talk to him because of this. Throughout his highschool years he grew to resent her and leaned more and more on his parents for support

## Modern Day
After being kicked out of his parents house at 18, he began living with [[Characters/Xexiax\|Xexiax]] again and found out the truth of her absence from his home. After several months, he got a job at [[Stores/Sword City\|Sword City]] within [[Stores/The Lazarus Center\|The Lazarus Center]] and began to get closer with the other employees and his manager; [[Characters/Major Leia\|Major Leia]]
